**Open Interpreter** works with both hosted and local language models.

Hosted models are faster and far more capable, but require payment. Local models are private and free, but are often difficult to set up.

For this reason, we recommend starting with a **hosted** model, then switching to a local model once you've explored Open Interpreter's capabilities.
