title: 'Local Settings'

Most settings — like model architecture and GPU offloading — can be adjusted via [LM Studio.](https://lmstudio.ai/)

**However, `max_tokens` and `context_window` should be set via Open Interpreter.**

For local mode, smaller context windows will use less RAM, so we recommend trying a much shorter window (~1000) if it's is failing or if it's slow. 

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
interpreter --local --max_tokens 1000 --context_window 3000
```

```python Python
import interpreter

interpreter.local = True
interpreter.max_tokens = 1000 
interpreter.context_window = 3000

interpreter.chat()
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>Make sure `max_tokens` is less than `context_window`.</Info>
