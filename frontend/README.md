# How to run repo

1. Make sure you have the correct `.env` file.
2. Run `pnpm dev` in the `nextjsapp/` folder to run it on `localhost:3000`.

# Notes to self

Make sure you're doing everything with `pnpm`.

Adding packages:
`pnpm add -D <packagename`

Run NextJS app locally with local docker container
`pnpm dev`

Run NextJS app locally with remote (E2B) docker container
`pnpm dev:e2b`

See `agents/open-interpreter/README.md` for more info on running and deploying those Docker containers.
